# Advent Of Code
Each year I try to try to keep my former developer skills (somewhat) up to date by playing the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) with my some of former colleagues:
* [Arjen](https://github.com/ArjenL/AoC2023)
* [Mike](https://github.com/miquels/adventofcode2023)
* [Robert](https://github.com/rj667/adventofcode2023)
* [Maurice](https://github.com/mmakaay/adventofcode2023)
* [abeltje](https://github.com/abeltje/AoC2023)
* [Cor](https://github.com/corbosman/advent2023/)
* [JP](https://github.com/jpcornet/AoC2023)

And who knows, maybe I'll even finish this year O:)
